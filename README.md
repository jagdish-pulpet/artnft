*(Placeholder for screenshots of key application screens: Home Dashboard, NFT Details, Create NFT, Dashboard Page, Search Page, Admin Panel views, etc.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The ArtNFT Marketplace is a full-stack application composed of a Next.js frontend and Supabase as its backend.

**Frontend (User Interface & Client-Side Logic):**
*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v15+ with App Router)
*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **UI Components:** [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (built on Radix UI)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (utility-first, with HSL-based theming)
*   **AI Integration (Specific Features):** [Genkit (by Google)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) utilizing Google AI models (e.g., Gemini) for features like NFT content generation assistance. Genkit flows run within the Next.js server environment.
*   **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
*   **State Management (Client-Side):**
    *   React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer` via `useToast`).
    *   `useRouter`, `usePathname`, `useSearchParams` for route-based state.
*   **Form Handling:** Standard React form handling, `react-hook-form` for more complex scenarios.
*   **Routing:** Next.js App Router.
*   **Font:** 'Inter' (via Google Fonts).
*   **API Communication (Frontend):**
    *   `fetch` API for Next.js API Routes (e.g., `/api/crypto-stats`).
    *   Supabase client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`) for all backend interactions (database, auth, storage).

**Backend (Server-Side Logic & Database - via Supabase):**
*   **Platform:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
*   **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (managed by Supabase)
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (JWT-based)
*   **Storage:** Supabase Storage (for NFT images, etc.)
*   **Serverless Functions:** Supabase Edge Functions (for custom server-side logic if needed beyond direct DB access)
*   **Realtime:** Supabase Realtime (for features like live auction updates, notifications)
*   **API Layer:** Auto-generated RESTful and GraphQL APIs by Supabase, direct database access via client library.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

ArtNFT Marketplace leverages a modern architecture with a Next.js frontend and Supabase backend:

*   **Next.js Frontend:**
    *   **App Router:** Enables a robust file-system based routing, supporting layouts, nested routes, and optimized rendering strategies (Server Components, Client Components).
    *   **Component-Based UI:** React is used to build a modular and reusable component library, with core UI elements provided by ShadCN UI.
    *   **State Management:** Primarily React Hooks for local/component state and route-based state.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility classes, global theme in `src/app/globals.css` (HSL variables).
    *   **Genkit for AI (Specific Features):** AI functionalities like NFT content generation are encapsulated in Genkit "flows." These flows are server-side modules (`'use server';`) within the Next.js application.
    *   **Supabase Client:** The frontend uses the Supabase client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`) for all interactions with the backend (authentication, database CRUD, file storage).

*   **Supabase Backend:**
    *   **PostgreSQL Database:** Stores all application data (users, NFTs, categories, etc.).
    *   **Supabase Auth:** Handles user sign-up, login, session management, and password recovery.
    *   **Supabase Storage:** Stores NFT images and other media assets.
    *   **Row Level Security (RLS):** Enforces data access policies directly in the database.
    *   **Supabase Edge Functions (Optional):** For custom, complex backend logic that can't be achieved through direct client-to-database operations or RLS.
    *   **Auto-Generated APIs:** Supabase provides RESTful and GraphQL APIs for interacting with the database, though direct client library usage is often preferred in Next.js.

*   **Communication:**
    *   The Next.js frontend communicates directly with Supabase services using the Supabase client library.
    *   The Next.js API Route for `/api/crypto-stats` directly fetches from an external API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Next.js frontend running with Supabase.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account and project.

### Installation & Setup

#### Frontend Setup (Next.js - Root Project)

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jagdish-pulpet/artnft.git
    cd artnft 
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Frontend Environment Variables (`.env.local` in the root project directory):**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying `.env.local.example` or creating it new.
    *   **Supabase Credentials:**
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE
        ```
        (Find these in your Supabase project settings: Project Settings -> API)
    *   **Direct Database Connection (for Next.js API Routes connecting to Supabase DB):**
        ```env
        DB_DIALECT=postgres
        DB_HOST=db.YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co

2.  **Database Schema Setup (via Supabase Studio or SQL):**
    *   Navigate to the "Table Editor" in your Supabase project dashboard.
    *   Define your tables (e.g., `profiles`, `nfts`, `categories`, `collections`, `favorites`, `bids`, `transactions`).
    *   Define relationships between tables (foreign keys).
    *   Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on your tables and define initial policies. Example:
        ```sql
        -- Example for a 'profiles' table linked to auth.users
        CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
          username TEXT UNIQUE,
          avatar_url TEXT,
          bio TEXT,
          updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
        );
        ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        CREATE POLICY "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (true);
        CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile." ON profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
        CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile." ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

        -- Example for 'nfts' table
        CREATE TABLE public.nfts (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
            user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
            title TEXT NOT NULL,
            description TEXT,
            image_url TEXT,

    *   Refer to the Supabase documentation for detailed schema design and RLS best practices.

### Running Development Servers

1.  **Run the Next.js frontend development server (from the root `artnft` directory):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the frontend application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Run the Genkit development server (from the root `artnft` directory, in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This starts Genkit in watch mode. Genkit usually starts its developer UI on `http://localhost:4000`.

Your Supabase backend is live and managed by Supabase, so no separate backend server needs to be run locally (unless you are developing Supabase Edge Functions locally with the Supabase CLI).

You should now have:
*   Frontend running on `http://localhost:9002`
*   Genkit Dev UI on `http://localhost:4000`
*   Your Supabase project accessible via its URL.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized with a Next.js frontend and Supabase as the backend.

## üé® Styling & Theming

*   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility classes are used for most styling in the frontend.
*   **ShadCN UI:** Components come pre-styled but are customizable.
*   **Global Theme:** `src/app/globals.css` defines CSS HSL variables for primary, secondary, accent, background, foreground, and other colors. This allows for easy theme changes and supports light/dark mode.
*   **Dark Mode:** Implemented using Tailwind's `dark:` variant, controlled by a class on the `html` tag (managed via the Settings page and `localStorage`).

## ü§ñ AI Integration (Genkit)

*   **Genkit by Google:** The project uses Genkit for specific Generative AI functionalities within the Next.js application.
*   **Flows:** AI logic is organized into "flows" located in `src/ai/flows/`. These are server-side modules within the Next.js app environment.
    *   `generateNftDescriptionFlow`: Creates compelling descriptions for NFTs.
    *   (Planned) `suggestNftTitlesFlow`: Suggests catchy and relevant titles for NFTs.
    *   (Planned) `suggestNftTagsFlow`: Recommends relevant tags/keywords for NFT discoverability.
*   **Models:** Configured to use Google AI models (e.g., Gemini) via the `@genkit-ai/googleai` plugin. API keys are managed through `.env.local`.
*   **Use Cases:** Implemented in the "Create NFT" page to assist users with content generation.

## üåç Building for Production

**Frontend (Next.js):**
```bash
npm run build
```
To start the Next.js production server (after building):
```bash
npm run start
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

*   **Next.js Frontend & Genkit:** This project is configured for deployment on [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting) using `apphosting.yaml`. Alternatives include Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify.
*   **Supabase Backend:** Supabase is a hosted service. You deploy your schema and functions directly to Supabase.
