## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended) and npm (or yarn/pnpm).
- **PostgreSQL Server:** A running instance of PostgreSQL (version 12 or later recommended).
- **Firebase Project:** A Firebase project with:
    - Firebase Storage enabled.
    - A Firebase service account key (JSON file).
- **For Email Functionality (Forgot Password):** SMTP server or email sending service credentials (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun).
- **For React Native Development:** See `react-native-app/README.md` for detailed prerequisites.

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository (or download the project files).
2. Navigate into the project's root directory.

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory (usually the project root if not a monorepo, or `src/` if `package.json` is at root).
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root directory (alongside `package.json`) and add:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/api 
   # Replace with your actual backend URL if different
   ```
   (Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` points to your running backend API, which is `/api` not just the base URL of the backend server itself)

### Backend Setup (Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL)
Located in the `artnft-backend/` directory.

#### PostgreSQL Setup
1.  **Install PostgreSQL:** If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, download and install it from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2.  **Create Database User (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Using `psql` or a GUI tool like pgAdmin, create a dedicated user for your application. Replace `your_db_user` and `your_strong_password` with your desired credentials.
        ```sql
        CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_strong_password';
        ```
3.  **Create Database:**
    *   Create the database that your application will use. Replace `artnft_db` with the name you will use in your `.env` file for `DB_DATABASE`.
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE artnft_db;
        ```
    *   Grant privileges to your user on the new database:
        ```sql
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE artnft_db TO your_db_user;
        ALTER DATABASE artnft_db OWNER TO your_db_user;
        ```
        (If you didn't create a separate user, your default PostgreSQL superuser will own it).

#### Firebase Setup
1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
2.  **Enable Firebase Storage:** In your Firebase project, navigate to "Storage" and click "Get started". Follow the prompts to enable Cloud Storage. Note your Storage bucket URL (it usually looks like `your-project-id.appspot.com`).
3.  **Generate a Service Account Key:**
    *   In the Firebase Console, go to "Project settings" (click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è).
    *   Select the "Service accounts" tab.
    *   Click "Generate new private key" and confirm. A JSON file will be downloaded. **Keep this file secure!**
4.  **Configure Firebase in Backend:** You have two options for providing the service account key to the backend:
    *   **Option A (File Path - Recommended for local development):**
        *   Place the downloaded JSON key file somewhere accessible to your backend project (e.g., in the `artnft-backend/` root, but **ensure it's added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing it to version control**).
        *   Set the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` environment variable in `artnft-backend/.env` to the path of this JSON file (e.g., `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./your-service-account-key.json`).
    *   **Option B (Base64 Encoded JSON):**
        *   Convert the content of the downloaded JSON key file into a single-line Base64 encoded string.
        *   Set the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` environment variable in `artnft-backend/.env` to this Base64 string.
        *   **Note:** If both `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` and `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` are set, the file path usually takes precedence.

#### Environment Variables (`artnft-backend/.env`)
1. Navigate to the `artnft-backend/` directory.
2. Create a `.env` file (you can copy `.env.example` if it exists and rename it).
3. Fill in the required environment variables:
   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USERNAME=your_db_user        # Your PostgreSQL username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password # Your PostgreSQL password
   DB_DATABASE=artnft_db           # Your PostgreSQL database name

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_and_long_jwt_secret_key_at_least_32_characters
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h               # Or other duration like 7d, 3600 (for seconds)

   # Firebase Configuration
   # Option A: Path to service account key (ensure file is in .gitignore)
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./path-to-your-firebase-service-account-key.json
   # Option B: Base64 encoded service account key JSON (if not using file path)
   # FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64=your_base64_encoded_json_key
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com # Your Firebase Storage bucket URL

   # Email Transport Configuration (for password reset, etc.)
   # These are required for Nodemailer to send emails.
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com     # Your SMTP server hostname
   EMAIL_PORT=587                  # Your SMTP server port (e.g., 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
   EMAIL_USER=your_smtp_username   # Your SMTP username
   EMAIL_PASS=your_smtp_password   # Your SMTP password
   EMAIL_FROM="ArtNFT Support <no-reply@artnft.example.com>" # Sender email address

   # Server Configuration
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development            # 'production' or 'development'
   ```

#### Database Migrations
1. Install backend dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd artnft-backend
   npm install
   ```
2. Run TypeORM migrations to create database tables:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```
   Ensure your database server is running and the `.env` file is correctly configured before running migrations.

### React Native App Setup
1.  Navigate to the `react-native-app/` directory.
2.  Follow the setup instructions in `react-native-app/README.md`. This typically involves installing dependencies (`npm install`) and then running the app on an emulator/simulator or physical device (`npm start` or `expo start`).

### Running Development Servers
- **Frontend (Next.js):**
  ```bash
  # In the project root directory (where Next.js package.json is)
  npm run dev
  ```
  (Usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:9002`)

- **Backend (Node.js/Express):**
  ```bash
  # In the artnft-backend/ directory
  npm run dev
  ```
  (Usually accessible at `http://localhost:3001`)

- **React Native App (Expo):**
  ```bash
  # In the react-native-app/ directory
  npm start
  # or
  expo start
  ```
  (Follow instructions in the terminal to open on a device/emulator)

- **Genkit (AI Features - for Web App):**
  ```bash
  # In the project root directory (where Genkit config likely resides)
  npm run genkit:dev
  ```
  (Genkit developer UI usually accessible at `http://localhost:4000`)

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing

A robust testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the reliability, security, and functionality of the ArtNFT Marketplace across all platforms (web, backend, mobile).

### Backend Testing (`artnft-backend/`)
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   **Services (`AuthService`, `NftService`, `OfferService`, `StatsService`, etc.):**
        -   Test individual service methods in isolation.
        -   Mock database repository calls (`AppDataSource.getRepository(...).find...`, `.save`, etc.) to control inputs and verify outputs without actual database interaction.
        -   **`AuthService`**:
            *   Mock `ethers.verifyMessage` to simulate valid and invalid signature scenarios for `signInWithWallet`.
            *   Mock `nodemailer.createTransport().sendMail` to test `initiatePasswordReset` logic (e.g., token generation, user updates) without actual email dispatch. Ensure correct parameters are passed to the mailer.
            *   Test password hashing and comparison logic.
        -   **`OfferService`**: Test offer creation, acceptance (including NFT state changes, transaction logging, rejection of other offers), rejection, and cancellation logic with various valid and invalid inputs. Verify atomicity of transactions.
        -   **`StatsService`**: Test aggregation logic for trading volume, top collections/NFTs, and leaderboards, ensuring correct calculations with mock transaction data. Cover edge cases (no data, single data point, etc.).
    -   **Controllers:** Test request handling, DTO validation, and correct service method calls. Mock service dependencies.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Test interactions between components, typically at the API endpoint level.
    -   Use a test database (e.g., a separate PostgreSQL instance or schema) populated with test data.
    -   **Authentication Flow (`/api/auth/`):** Test full signup, signin (email/password), wallet signin (with a mechanism to provide mock signatures or a test wallet provider if possible in CI), forgot password, and reset password API flows.
    -   **Offer Flow (`/api/offers/`, `/api/nfts/.../offers`):** Test creating, viewing, accepting, rejecting, and canceling offers via API calls, verifying database state changes (NFT ownership, offer status, transaction records).
    -   **Stats Endpoints (`/api/stats/`):** Test endpoints with various query parameters (periods, limits, sortBy), ensuring correct data aggregation and response structure. Test against known datasets.
    -   Verify middleware (auth, admin role, validation) behavior.

### Frontend Testing (`src/` - Web Application)
-   **Component Tests (e.g., using React Testing Library with Jest/Vitest):**
    -   Test individual components like `WalletConnectModal` (various states, button interactions, error display), `SigninForm`, `NftCard`, `MakeOfferModal`, `PaginationControls`, etc.
    *   Verify UI rendering based on props and state.
    *   Test user interactions (button clicks, form inputs) and that they trigger expected callbacks or state changes.
    *   Mock `apiService` calls to simulate backend responses and test how components react to success/error states.
    *   For components interacting with wallet providers (e.g., `WalletConnectModal`), mock the `window.ethereum` object or relevant parts of wallet library SDKs to simulate different scenarios (wallet not installed, connection rejected, signature rejected, successful connection/signature).
-   **Integration Tests (Frontend Context):**
    -   Test flows involving multiple components and context providers.
    *   **Wallet Login Flow (`WalletConnectModal` + `AuthContext`):** Simulate MetaMask connection, message signing, and the `AuthContext.login` call. Verify UI updates based on authentication state.
    *   **Forgot Password Flow (`ForgotPasswordForm`):** Test form submission and the display of success/error messages from `AuthContext`.
    *   **Offer Creation/Management (`NftDetailPage`, `MakeOfferModal`, `ProfilePage` Offers Tab):** Test opening modals, submitting offer forms, and UI updates when offers are created or their status changes.

### Mobile App Testing (`react-native-app/`)
-   **Unit Tests (e.g., using Jest with React Native Testing Library):**
    -   Test individual React Native components (buttons, inputs, cards) for rendering and basic interactions.
    -   Test utility functions, API service logic (mocking `axios` or `fetch`).
    -   Test state management logic (e.g., reducers, context updates).
-   **Component Integration Tests:**
    -   Test how screens compose and interact with their child components.
    -   Verify navigation between screens.
    -   Mock API calls to test screen behavior with different data responses.
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (e.g., using Detox, Appium, or Maestro):**
    -   Simulate full user flows on emulators/simulators or real devices.
    -   Test core scenarios: signup, login (email/wallet), profile viewing/editing, NFT/collection browsing, making offers (if implemented).
    -   Requires setting up a dedicated E2E testing framework for React Native.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Overall Application - Web)
-   Simulate full user journeys through the web application in a real browser environment (e.g., using Cypress, Playwright).
-   **Authentication & Recovery:**
    -   User successfully signs up with email/password.
    *   User successfully signs in with email/password.
    *   User successfully signs in using MetaMask (requires browser extension support in the E2E tool or a way to mock wallet interactions at the browser level).
    *   User attempts to sign in with invalid credentials (email/password, wallet signature).
    *   User successfully requests a password reset email and completes the password reset flow (requires a way to intercept or read emails in the test environment, or mock the token validation part of the reset flow).
-   **Core Marketplace Flows (Web):**
    *   User browses NFTs and collections.
    *   User creates an NFT and a Collection.
    *   User makes an offer on an NFT.
    *   NFT owner accepts/rejects an offer made by another user.
    *   User views their profile and activity.
-   **Admin Panel Flows (Web):**
    *   Admin logs in.
    *   Admin views and performs basic management actions on users, NFTs, collections.

### General Testing Principles:
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Automate tests to run on every commit/pull request for all parts of the project (backend, web frontend, mobile app).
-   **Test Coverage:** Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical business logic (auth, offers, sales) and user flows.
-   **Mocking:** Use appropriate mocking strategies for external services (payment gateways if any, blockchain interactions if not fully on-chain yet, email services in unit/integration tests) and browser/native APIs (like `window.ethereum` or mobile device features).
-   **Data Seeding:** Use consistent test data seeding strategies for integration and E2E tests.
