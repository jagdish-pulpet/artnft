*(Placeholder for screenshots of key application screens: Home Dashboard, NFT Details, Create NFT, Dashboard Page, Search Page, Admin Panel views, etc.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The ArtNFT Marketplace is a full-stack application composed of a Next.js frontend and a Node.js backend.

**Frontend (User Interface & Client-Side Logic):**
*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v15+ with App Router)
*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **UI Components:** [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (built on Radix UI)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (utility-first, with HSL-based theming)
*   **AI Integration (Specific Features):** [Genkit (by Google)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) utilizing Google AI models (e.g., Gemini) for features like NFT content generation assistance. Genkit flows run within the Next.js server environment.
*   **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
*   **State Management (Client-Side):**
    *   React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer` via `useToast`).
    *   `useRouter`, `usePathname`, `useSearchParams` for route-based state.
*   **Form Handling:** Standard React form handling, `react-hook-form` for more complex scenarios.
*   **Routing:** Next.js App Router.
*   **Font:** 'Inter' (via Google Fonts).
*   **API Communication (Frontend):**
    *   `fetch` API for Next.js API Routes (e.g., `/api/crypto-stats`).
    *   `fetch` API to communicate with the dedicated Node.js backend (`artnft-backend-node/`) for core application data and authentication.

**Backend (Server-Side Logic & Database - In Progress, located in `artnft-backend-node/`):**
*   **Framework:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
*   **Language:** JavaScript (initial implementation, can be evolved to TypeScript)
*   **Database:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) for MySQL database interactions.
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure sessions, `bcryptjs` for password hashing.
*   **API Layer:** RESTful APIs to be consumed by the Next.js frontend.
*   **Environment Management:** `dotenv` for managing environment variables (database credentials, JWT secrets).
*   **Other Key Libraries:** `cors` for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

ArtNFT Marketplace leverages a modern, decoupled architecture:

*   **Next.js Frontend:**
    *   **App Router:** Enables a robust file-system based routing, supporting layouts, nested routes, and optimized rendering strategies (Server Components, Client Components).
    *   **Component-Based UI:** React is used to build a modular and reusable component library, with core UI elements provided by ShadCN UI.
    *   **State Management:** Primarily React Hooks for local/component state and route-based state.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility classes, global theme in `src/app/globals.css` (HSL variables).
    *   **Genkit for AI (Specific Features):** AI functionalities like NFT content generation are encapsulated in Genkit "flows." These flows are server-side modules (`'use server';`) within the Next.js application.
    *   **API Calls:** The frontend uses `fetch` to communicate with the RESTful APIs provided by the separate Node.js backend.

*   **Node.js Backend (`artnft-backend-node/`):**
    *   **Express.js Framework:** Provides the foundation for building RESTful APIs.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Exposes endpoints for user authentication (signup, login), NFT management (CRUD), category management, etc.
    *   **Business Logic:** Services layer handles core application logic.
    *   **Database Interaction:** Models (using Sequelize ORM) define the structure of data and interact with the MySQL database.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Manages user sessions using JWTs and password security with bcrypt.

*   **Communication:**
    *   The Next.js frontend communicates with the Node.js backend via HTTP requests to its RESTful API endpoints.
    *   The frontend sends data (e.g., login credentials, new NFT details) to the backend and receives data (e.g., user information, NFT listings) in JSON format.
    *   The Next.js API Route for `/api/crypto-stats` directly fetches from an external API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get both the frontend and backend running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended for both frontend and backend)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) installed and running.
*   A MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or command-line client) to manage the database.

### Installation & Setup

#### Frontend Setup (Next.js - Root Project)

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jagdish-pulpet/artnft.git
    cd artnft 
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Frontend Environment Variables (`.env.local` in the root project directory):**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying `.env.local.example` (if it exists) or creating it new.
    *   Add your Google AI Studio API key (or other Genkit provider keys):
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   Add your CoinMarketCap API Key (for the Stats page):
        ```env
        COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=YOUR_COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   Add the URL for your local backend server (this will be the Node.js backend):
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 
        ```
        (Ensure the port `5000` matches what your Node.js backend will run on, as defined in its `.env` file).

#### Backend Setup (Node.js/Express/MySQL - `artnft-backend-node/` directory)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd artnft-backend-node
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Backend Environment Variables (`.env` in `artnft-backend-node/` directory):**
    *   In the `artnft-backend-node/` directory, copy the `artnft-backend-node/.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.
    *   Open `artnft-backend-node/.env` and fill in your MySQL database credentials:
        ```env
        NODE_ENV=development
        PORT=5000 # Port the backend server will run on
        
        # MySQL Database Connection
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_mysql_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
        DB_NAME=artnft_db # Or your chosen database name
        DB_PORT=3306

        # JWT Configuration
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_JWT_SECRET_KEY_HERE 
        JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d # Example: token expires in 1 day
        ```
    *   **Important:** Replace `your_mysql_user`, `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL credentials. Choose a strong, random string for `JWT_SECRET`.

4.  **MySQL Database and Schema Setup:**
    *   Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    *   Using your MySQL client, create the database specified in `artnft-backend-node/.env` (e.g., `artnft_db`).
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE artnft_db; 
        ```
    *   Apply the database schema using the `artnft-backend-node/schema.sql` file. From within the `artnft-backend-node` directory, you can use a command like (adjust for your MySQL client and credentials):
        ```bash
        mysql -u your_mysql_user -p artnft_db < schema.sql
        ```
        (You will be prompted for your MySQL password).

### Running Development Servers

The Next.js frontend, Genkit (for AI flows), and the Node.js backend need to be run concurrently in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Run the Next.js frontend development server (from the root `artnft` directory):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the frontend application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Run the Genkit development server (from the root `artnft` directory, in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This starts Genkit in watch mode. Genkit usually starts its developer UI on `http://localhost:4000`.

3.  **Run the Node.js backend server (from the `artnft-backend-node/` directory, in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    cd artnft-backend-node
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the backend server, typically on `http://localhost:5000` (or the `PORT` specified in `artnft-backend-node/.env`). Look for console messages indicating the server is running and connected to the database.

You should now have:
*   Frontend running on `http://localhost:9002`
*   Backend running on `http://localhost:5000`
*   Genkit Dev UI on `http://localhost:4000`

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into a Next.js frontend and a separate Node.js backend.

## üé® Styling & Theming

*   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility classes are used for most styling in the frontend.
*   **ShadCN UI:** Components come pre-styled but are customizable.
*   **Global Theme:** `src/app/globals.css` defines CSS HSL variables for primary, secondary, accent, background, foreground, and other colors. This allows for easy theme changes and supports light/dark mode.
*   **Dark Mode:** Implemented using Tailwind's `dark:` variant, controlled by a class on the `html` tag (managed via the Settings page and `localStorage`).

## ü§ñ AI Integration (Genkit)

*   **Genkit by Google:** The project uses Genkit for specific Generative AI functionalities within the Next.js application.
*   **Flows:** AI logic is organized into "flows" located in `src/ai/flows/`. These are server-side modules within the Next.js app environment.
    *   `generateNftDescriptionFlow`: Creates compelling descriptions for NFTs.
    *   `suggestNftTitlesFlow`: Suggests catchy and relevant titles for NFTs.
    *   `suggestNftTagsFlow`: Recommends relevant tags/keywords for NFT discoverability.
*   **Models:** Configured to use Google AI models (e.g., Gemini) via the `@genkit-ai/googleai` plugin. API keys are managed through `.env.local` for the frontend.
*   **Use Cases:** Implemented in the "Create NFT" page to assist users with content generation.

## üåç Building for Production

**Frontend (Next.js):**
```bash
npm run build
```
To start the Next.js production server (after building):
```bash
npm run start
```

**Backend (Node.js):**
Navigate to `artnft-backend-node/`:
```bash
# No explicit build step for basic JS backend, unless using TypeScript or bundler
npm start   # Typically starts the production server (e.g., node src/server.js)
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

*   **Next.js Frontend:** This project is configured for deployment on [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting) using `apphosting.yaml`. Alternatives include Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify.
*   **Node.js Backend:** Requires a Node.js hosting environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud App Engine/Cloud Run, DigitalOcean App Platform, Render).
*   **MySQL Database:** Can be hosted on services like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, DigitalOcean Managed Databases, or a self-managed MySQL server.
