// This file is intentionally kept empty or with only comments
// to prevent Next.js from treating it as a page route.
// The actual admin functionality should be handled by routes
// within the (admin) route group, such as /src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx
// or a specific /src/app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx if one is intended for the /admin root.
// By not exporting a default React component, this file will not
// create a page route for /admin.
