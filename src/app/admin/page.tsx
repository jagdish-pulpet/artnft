// This file is intentionally kept minimal to prevent routing conflicts
// with the (admin) route group structure (e.g., /src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard).
// By not exporting a default React component, this file does not create a page route for /admin.
// The actual admin landing/redirect logic should occur within the (admin) group.
