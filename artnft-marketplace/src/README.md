---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended) and npm (or yarn/pnpm).
- **PostgreSQL Server:** A running instance of PostgreSQL (version 12 or later recommended).
- **Firebase Project:** A Firebase project with:
    - Firebase Storage enabled.
    - A Firebase service account key (JSON file).
- **For Email Functionality (Forgot Password):** SMTP server or email sending service credentials (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun).
- **For React Native Development:** See `react-native-app/README.md` for detailed prerequisites (includes Expo CLI, Android Studio/Xcode setup).
- **For Web WalletConnect**: An Infura ID (or similar RPC provider URL) for `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID` in `.env.local` if you plan to connect to mainnet or specific testnets via WalletConnect on the web.

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository (or download the project files).
2. Navigate into the project's root directory.

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory (usually the project root, where the `package.json` with Next.js dependencies is).
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root directory (e.g., copy `.env.local.example` if provided, or create from scratch). Add:
   ```env
   # File: .env.local (in the root of your artnft-marketplace project)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/api 
   # Replace with your actual backend URL if different
   
   # Optional: For Web WalletConnect if connecting to specific RPCs
   # Replace YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID with your actual ID
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID=YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID 
   ```
   (Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` points to your running backend API, which is `/api` not just the base URL of the backend server itself)

### Backend Setup (Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL)
Located in the `artnft-backend/` directory.

#### PostgreSQL Setup
1.  **Install PostgreSQL:** If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, download and install it from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2.  **Create Database User (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Using `psql` or a GUI tool like pgAdmin, create a dedicated user for your application. Replace `your_db_user` and `your_strong_password` with your desired credentials.
        ```sql
        CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_strong_password';
        ```
3.  **Create Database:**
    *   Create the database that your application will use. Replace `artnft_db` with the name you will use in your `.env` file for `DB_DATABASE`.
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE artnft_db;
        ```
    *   Grant privileges to your user on the new database:
        ```sql
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE artnft_db TO your_db_user;
        ALTER DATABASE artnft_db OWNER TO your_db_user;
        ```
        (If you didn't create a separate user, your default PostgreSQL superuser will own it).

#### Firebase Setup
1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
2.  **Enable Firebase Storage:** In your Firebase project, navigate to "Storage" and click "Get started". Follow the prompts to enable Cloud Storage. Note your Storage bucket URL (it usually looks like `your-project-id.appspot.com`).
3.  **Generate a Service Account Key:**
    *   In the Firebase Console, go to "Project settings" (click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è).
    *   Select the "Service accounts" tab.
    *   Click "Generate new private key" and confirm. A JSON file will be downloaded. **Keep this file secure!**
4.  **Configure Firebase in Backend:** You have two options for providing the service account key to the backend:
    *   **Option A (File Path - Recommended for local development):**
        *   Place the downloaded JSON key file somewhere accessible to your backend project (e.g., in the `artnft-backend/` root, but **ensure it's added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing it to version control**).
        *   Set the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` environment variable in `artnft-backend/.env` to the path of this JSON file (e.g., `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./your-service-account-key.json`).
    *   **Option B (Base64 Encoded JSON):**
        *   Convert the content of the downloaded JSON key file into a single-line Base64 encoded string.
        *   Set the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` environment variable in `artnft-backend/.env` to this Base64 string.
        *   **Note:** If both `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` and `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` are set, the file path usually takes precedence.

#### Environment Variables (`artnft-backend/.env`)
1. Navigate to the `artnft-backend/` directory.
2. Create a `.env` file (you can copy `artnft-backend/.env.example` if it exists and rename it, or create one from scratch).
3. Fill in the required environment variables:
   ```env
   # File: artnft-backend/.env

   # Database Configuration
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USERNAME=your_db_user        # Your PostgreSQL username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password # Your PostgreSQL password
   DB_DATABASE=artnft_db           # Your PostgreSQL database name

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_and_long_jwt_secret_key_at_least_32_characters # IMPORTANT: Change this to a secure random string
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h               # Or other duration like 7d, 3600 (for seconds)

   # Firebase Configuration
   # Option A: Path to service account key (ensure file is in .gitignore)
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./path-to-your-firebase-service-account-key.json
   # Option B: Base64 encoded service account key JSON (if not using file path)
   # FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64=your_base64_encoded_json_key
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com # Your Firebase Storage bucket URL

   # Email Transport Configuration (for password reset, etc.)
   # These are required for Nodemailer to send emails.
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com     # Your SMTP server hostname
   EMAIL_PORT=587                  # Your SMTP server port (e.g., 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
   EMAIL_USER=your_smtp_username   # Your SMTP username
   EMAIL_PASS=your_smtp_password   # Your SMTP password
   EMAIL_FROM="ArtNFT Support <no-reply@artnft.example.com>" # Sender email address

   # Server Configuration
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development            # 'production' or 'development'
   ```
   **Note:** An `.env.example` file is typically provided in `artnft-backend/` as a template.

#### Database Migrations
1. Install backend dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd artnft-backend
   npm install
   ```
2. **CRITICAL:** Ensure your database server is running and the `artnft-backend/.env` file is correctly configured with your database connection details *before* running migrations.
3. Run TypeORM migrations to create database tables:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```

### React Native App Setup
1.  Navigate to the `react-native-app/` directory.
2.  Follow the detailed setup instructions in `react-native-app/README.md`. This includes installing dependencies (like `@walletconnect/react-native-dapp`, `expo-image-picker`) and setting up environment variables for the mobile app (including `API_URL` and deep linking configuration for WalletConnect).

### Running Development Servers
- **Frontend (Next.js):**
  ```bash
  # In the project root directory (where Next.js package.json is)

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing

A robust testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the reliability, security, and functionality of the ArtNFT Marketplace across all platforms (web, backend, mobile).

### Backend Testing (`artnft-backend/`)
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   **Services (`AuthService`, `NftService`, `OfferService`, `StatsService`, etc.):**
        *   Test individual service methods in isolation.
        *   Mock database repository calls (`AppDataSource.getRepository(...).find...`, `.save`, etc.) to control inputs and verify outputs without actual database interaction.
        *   **`AuthService`**: Mock `ethers.verifyMessage` to simulate valid/invalid signatures for `signInWithWallet`. Mock `nodemailer.createTransport().sendMail` for `initiatePasswordReset`. Test password hashing.
        *   **`OfferService`**: Test offer creation, acceptance (NFT state changes, transaction logging, rejection of other offers), rejection, cancellation. Verify atomicity.
        *   **`StatsService`**: Test aggregation logic for trading volume, top collections/NFTs, leaderboards with mock data.
    -   **Controllers:** Test request handling, DTO validation, and service method calls. Mock service dependencies.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Test interactions between components, typically at the API endpoint level. Use a test database.
    *   **Authentication Flow (`/api/auth/`):** Full signup, signin (email/password, wallet), forgot/reset password API flows.
    *   **Offer Flow (`/api/offers/`, `/api/nfts/.../offers`):** Create, view, accept, reject, cancel offers via API, verifying database state.
    *   **Stats Endpoints (`/api/stats/`):** Test with various query parameters.
    *   Verify middleware (auth, admin role, validation).

### Frontend Testing (`src/` - Web Application)
-   **Component Tests (e.g., using React Testing Library with Jest/Vitest):**
    -   Test components like `WalletConnectModal` (MetaMask & WalletConnect flows, error display), `SigninForm`, `NftCard`, `MakeOfferModal`.
    *   Verify UI rendering, user interactions, and state changes.
    *   Mock `apiService` calls and wallet provider SDKs (`window.ethereum`, `@walletconnect/web3-provider`).
-   **Integration Tests (Frontend Context):**
    *   Test flows like Wallet Login (`WalletConnectModal` + `AuthContext`), Forgot Password, Offer Creation.

### Mobile App Testing (`react-native-app/`)
-   **Unit Tests (e.g., using Jest with React Native Testing Library):**
    -   Test components (`WalletButtons`, forms, cards), utility functions, API service logic (mocking `axios`), state management (`authContext.tsx`).
    -   Mock `useWalletConnect` and `expo-image-picker` for component tests.
-   **Component Integration Tests:**
    -   Test screen composition, navigation, and API call effects on UI.
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (e.g., using Detox, Appium, or Maestro):**
    -   Simulate full user flows on emulators/devices: signup, login (email, WalletConnect), profile editing, NFT/collection creation & browsing.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Overall Application - Web & Mobile)
-   Simulate user journeys in real browser/device environments.
-   **Authentication & Recovery:** All signup/signin methods, password reset.
-   **Core Marketplace Flows:** Browsing, creating NFTs/Collections, making/managing offers.
-   **Admin Panel Flows (Web).**

### General Testing Principles:
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Automate tests on every commit/pull request.
-   **Test Coverage:** Aim for good coverage, especially for critical business logic.
-   **Mocking:** Use appropriate mocking for external services and APIs.
-   **Data Seeding:** Consistent test data for integration and E2E tests.
