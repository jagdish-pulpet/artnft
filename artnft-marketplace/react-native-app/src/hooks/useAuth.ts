// react-native-app/src/hooks/useAuth.ts
// This file is effectively replaced by the export from authContext.tsx
// For simplicity, we directly use the context there.
// If you need a more complex hook that derives state or adds more logic,
// you could re-introduce this, but for now, it's simpler to just use the context.

// export const useAuth = (): AuthContextType => {
//   const context = useContext(AuthContext); // Use this when AuthContext is implemented
//   if (!context) {
//     throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
//   }
//   return context;
// };

// This file can be deleted or kept empty if your ESLint rules prefer it.
// We'll keep it minimal or empty for now.
export {}; // Ensures it's treated as a module
